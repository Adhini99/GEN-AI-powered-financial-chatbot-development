BCG GenAI Job Simulation on Forage - September 2024
Completed a job simulation involving AI-powered financial chatbot development for BCG's GenAI Consulting team.
Gained experience in Python programming, including the use of libraries such as pandas for data manipulation.
Integrated and interpreted complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports, employing rule-based logic to create a chatbot that provides user-friendly financial insights and analysis.

I worked on a project to develop an AI-powered financial chatbot. I practiced using Excel, Python, pandas, and other libraries and built my data analysis and NLP skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I enjoy working on translating complex financial data into accessible insights through AI, and I'm excited to apply these skills on a GenAI Consulting team at a company like BCG.
